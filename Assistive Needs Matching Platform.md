## 6) Assistive Needs Matching Platform

### Project Description
A community-based platform that connects elderly, disabled, sick, or vulnerable individuals with nearby helpers willing to offer small, practical assistance.

### The Problem
Many vulnerable people need help with daily tasks but lack access to reliable support, while willing helpers don’t know who needs assistance nearby.

### Why It Needs to Be Solved
Social isolation and unmet basic needs reduce quality of life for vulnerable groups. Community support strengthens social bonds and dignity.

### How the Solution Solves It
- People post small assistive needs (errands, escort, check-ins)  
- Nearby helpers respond and offer support  
- Encourages safe, community-driven assistance  

### Problem Statement
Vulnerable individuals often lack access to nearby help for basic daily needs, despite the presence of willing community members.

### Solution Summary
A matching platform that connects people who need assistance with nearby helpers, fostering community support and inclusion.
